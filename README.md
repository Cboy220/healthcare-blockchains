# Where are the healthcare-related blockchains?
![healthcare blockchain](healthcare-blockchain.png)
We've drafted an open-source landscape map for healthcare-related blockchains. This repository was inspired by a conversation with [Paul](https://github.com/pfletcherhill) from [PatientBank](https://www.patientbank.us) and Chris from [Hashed Health](https://hashedhealth.com). We wanted to answer the question: *Who is working on blockchain-related technologies for our industry?*

## Overview & Methodology
There's a lot of opportunity to use blockchain technologies healthcare effectively -- [and there are a lot of myths, too](https://blog.andreacoravos.com/myth-busting-can-a-blockchain-save-healthcare-d398cdebf0c1). 

We put together a first cut of this map and wanted to open it up to the community to share updates. Most of the companies on this list are early stage—and some are vaporware. Over time, we hope to see more projects in production, but few are ready yet.
